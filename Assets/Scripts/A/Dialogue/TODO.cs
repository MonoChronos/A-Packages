//TODO: Make character list scriptable object that stores character specific variables (ACharacterData)
//TODO: Add dropdown that lists all of the characters in the characterdata collection (ACharacterDataCollection)
//The dropdown only appears when the character asset has been assigned and has to have a custom option
//Also lock the character specific fields when a character gets selected
